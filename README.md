# Local Weather

## Background
This app was built using express and ejs. In addition, Chai and Supertest was used to do some basic testing of functionality and api related things.

### How it works 
A user selects the option to view the current forcast in their given area and the temperature is returned to them along with an icon displaying wether it is snowing, sunny, windy, etc.
