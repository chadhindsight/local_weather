# Local Weather

## Background
This app was built using express and ejs. In addition, Chai and Supertest were used to do some basic testing of the functionality and api related to the requests made to the open weather API and making sure things load properly.

### How it works 
A user selects the option to view the current forecast by clicking a button. The forecast of their given location and the temperature is returned to them along with an icon displaying wether it is snowing, sunny, windy, etc.
